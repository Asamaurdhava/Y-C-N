# 🎯 YouTube Channel Notifier - Smart Relationship-Based Notifications

**🏆 Built for GitHub "For The Love of Code" 2025 Hackathon**

**Category: World Wide Wonders** - A surprisingly useful web extension that reveals your true YouTube relationships

*Built with the sophisticated assistance of Claude Code - where AI-powered development meets human creativity*

> **The Problem**: YouTube's subscription system notifies you about every video upload from subscribed channels, creating notification fatigue and spam.

> **Our Solution**: We genuinely notify you only for videos from channels you truly love, based on your actual viewing behavior.

## 🚀 What Makes This Different

### YouTube's Approach:
- Subscribe → Get ALL notifications
- No understanding of your actual interest
- Leads to notification spam and eventual opt-out

### Our Smart Approach:
- **Watch videos naturally** → We learn your preferences
- **Prove genuine interest** (10+ videos with 50%+ completion) → We ask for permission
- **Get notifications** only from channels you actually care about

**Result**: Zero spam, maximum relevance. Notifications you'll actually want to receive.

## 🧠 Intelligence Features

*Powered by Claude Code's advanced reasoning capabilities*

### 1. **Relationship Score Algorithm**
Developed with Claude Code's analytical prowess, we calculate a 0-100 score based on 5 factors:
- **Frequency** (30%): How often you watch their content
- **Recency** (20%): How recently you engaged  
- **Depth** (20%): How much of videos you actually watch
- **Loyalty** (20%): How consistently you return
- **Growth** (10%): Whether your interest is increasing/decreasing

### 2. **Smart Badges & UI**
- **🔴 Red badge**: Channels ready for approval (relationship proven)
- **🟢 Green badge**: Active notification channels (your inner circle)
- **🔵 Blue badge**: Still learning your preferences

### 3. **Emotional Connection**
- **Score 80+**: "❤️ Join Your Inner Circle" 
- **Score 60-79**: "😊 Add to Favorites"
- **Score 40-59**: "👍 Enable Notifications"
