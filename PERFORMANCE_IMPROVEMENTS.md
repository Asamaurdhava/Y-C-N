# Performance and Bug Fixes Applied

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. **Memory Leak Prevention**
- **Fixed interval cleanup**: Added proper cleanup for intervals before creating new ones in `startKeepAlive()`, `startUrlMonitoring()`, and `startContextValidationCheck()`
- **Event listener management**: Implemented proper removal of video event listeners to prevent memory leaks when videos change
- **Session data cleanup**: Added proper cleanup for session intelligence timeout

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Removed excessive logging**: Removed console.log for keep-alive pings that were flooding the console
- **Added cache control**: RSS feed fetching now uses `cache: 'no-cache'` to prevent stale data
- **Debounced storage operations**: Already implemented in PerformanceManager class

### 3. **Bug Fixes**
- **Notification listener leak**: Fixed notification button click listeners that were accumulating and never being removed
- **Const reassignment errors**: Fixed attempts to reassign const variables in storage operations
- **Interval management**: Prevented duplicate intervals by clearing existing ones before creating new ones

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Better error handling**: Extension context invalidation is now handled gracefully without spamming console
- **Resource cleanup**: Added comprehensive cleanup in destroy() method

## Additional Recommendations

### Storage Optimization
1. **Implement storage quota monitoring** - Chrome extensions have storage limits
2. **Consider using IndexedDB** for large datasets instead of chrome.storage.local
3. **Batch storage operations** when possible to reduce write frequency

### Network Optimization
1. **Implement request caching** for RSS feeds with smart invalidation
2. **Add retry logic with exponential backoff** for failed network requests
3. **Consider using ETag headers** for RSS feed conditional requests

### UI Performance
1. **Lazy load dashboard components** to improve initial load time
2. **Implement virtual scrolling** if channel list grows large
3. **Use requestAnimationFrame** for animations instead of setInterval

### Background Service Worker
1. **Implement alarm-based checking** instead of intervals for better battery life
2. **Use chrome.idle API** to pause non-critical operations when user is away
3. **Consider using Web Workers** for heavy computations

### Monitoring
1. **Add performance metrics tracking** using Performance API
2. **Implement error reporting** to catch and fix issues in production
3. **Add analytics** to understand usage patterns and optimize accordingly

## Testing Recommendations

### Performance Testing
- Test with 100+ channels to ensure scalability
- Monitor memory usage over extended periods
- Test on low-end devices

### Edge Cases
- Test behavior when storage quota is exceeded
- Test with slow/intermittent network connections
- Test extension update/reload scenarios

### Browser Compatibility
- Test on different Chromium-based browsers
- Verify Manifest V3 compliance
- Test with different YouTube layouts/experiments
