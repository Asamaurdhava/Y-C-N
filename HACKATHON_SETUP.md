## 🙏 Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate this project. This extension solves a real problem I face daily - notification fatigue from YouTube subscriptions. Instead of getting overwhelmed by every upload, this system learns what I actually watch and only notifies me about content I care about.

The collaboration with Claude Code helped elevate the code quality, architecture, and implementation of advanced features like the zero-knowledge Ghost Protocol.

I hope you enjoy testing it as much as I enjoyed building it!
